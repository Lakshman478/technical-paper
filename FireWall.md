# Firewall Description

**Firewalls** have existed since the late 1980s and started as [Packet filters](https://www.google.com/search?q=packet+filtering+firewall&oq=packet+filters&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i10i131i433j0j0i10l7.5568j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), which were networks set up to examine [packets](https://www.google.com/search?q=packets+in+a+firewall&oq=packets+in+fire&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0i22i30l5j0i390l3.9585j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), or [bytes](https://www.google.com/search?q=bytes+in+firewall&oq=bytes+in+fire&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j33i22i29i30l4.5712j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), transferred between computers. It is a software program that helps to screen out the hackers that try to reach your computer from the Internet.
 ## Introduction
A **Firewall** is a necessary part of any [security architecture](https://www.google.com/search?q=security+architecture&sxsrf=ALeKk0397W6T4AvTO0P5s2FVuTA6BqqMRA%3A1620447007741&ei=Hw-WYPfXLIzYz7sP2OCr2Ao&oq=security+architecture&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyCAgAELEDEIMBMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAOgcIIxCwAxAnOgcIABBHELADUMrWE1jK1hNg4OkTaAFwAngAgAHSAYgBiAOSAQUwLjEuMZgBAKABAqABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQnAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwi345fCm7nwAhUM7HMBHVjwCqsQ4dUDCA4&uact=5) and  lies in between your Internet and untrusted Internet. Firewalls, and especially NextGeneration Firewalls, focus on blocking malware and application-layer attacks, along with an integrated [intrusion prevention system (IPS)](https://www.google.com/search?q=intrusion+prevention+system&oq=intrusion+prevention+system&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l9.597j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). These would react very quickly and provide security. It is used to defend your network and carry suspicious activity by using software, like [malware](https://www.google.com/search?q=malware&oq=malware&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i433l2j0j0i433l2j0j0i433j0l2.413j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), and shut it down.

## There are 5 Generations

        - Gen 1 Virus
        - Gen 2 Networks
        - Gen 3 Applications
        - Gen 4 Payload
        - Gen 5 Mega
 Nowadays all the types of windows starting from Windows XP sp2 to windows 10, all are having an inbuilt software firewall. This is used to regulate the flow of traffic and permits secure data. In the absence of a firewall, hackers can hack easily. It is better, download the [Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Next+Generation+Firewall&oq=Next+Generation+Firewall&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59.369j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) Buyer’s Guide today. Today’s firewalls, including Next-Generation Firewalls and Network Firewalls, support a wide variety of functions and capabilities with built-in features, including:
* **[Network Threat Prevention](https://www.google.com/search?q=Network+Threat+Prevention&oq=Network+Threat+Prevention&aqs=chrome..69i57.839j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)**
* **[Application and Identity-Based Control](https://www.google.com/search?q=application+and+identity-based+control&oq=Application+and+Identity-Based+Control&aqs=chrome.0.0.1063j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)**
* **[Hybrid Cloud Support](https://www.google.com/search?q=hybrid+cloud+support&oq=Hybrid+Cloud+Support&aqs=chrome.0.0.509j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)**
* **[Scalable Performance](https://www.google.com/search?q=scale+performance&oq=scale+perfo&aqs=chrome.0.0l2j69i57j0i22i30l7.7096j1j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)**

## Types of Firewalls

        1. Packet filtering
        2. Proxy service
        3. stateful inspection
        4. Next-Generation Firewall(NGFW)

## **1. Packet filtering**

A small amount of data is analyzed and distributed according to the filter’s standards. Generation Firewalls inspect packets at the application level of the [TCP/IP stack](https://www.google.com/search?q=tcp%2Fip+stack+layers&oq=TCP%2FIP&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59j0l4j0i131i433j69i58.1896j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). In packet filtering, an IP address of both the sender and receiver will be maintained and along with the port numbers. This is how it protects our computer from a hacker. 
### **Syntax in Packet filter:**
```    
   #include "sys/io-pkt.h"
#include "nw_datastruct.h"

int mod_entry( void *dll_hdl, struct _iopkt_self *iopkt,
               char *options)
{

}
```

## **2. Proxy service**
In Proxy services, the Ip address of the end-user will be hidden. The Network security system protects while filtering messages at the application layer. Similarly, a [virtual private network (VPN)](https://www.google.com/search?q=virtual+private+network&oq=virtual+private+network&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l9.476j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) extends a private network across a public network within a tunnel that is often encrypted where the contents of the packets are protected while traversing the Internet.


## **3. Stateful inspection**
[Dynamic packet filtering](https://www.google.com/search?q=Dynamic+packet+filtering&oq=Dynamic+packet+filtering&aqs=chrome..69i57.453j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) that monitors active connections to determine which network packets to allow through the Firewall. Network maintaining the access and conversation list to maintain the stateful inspection. Thus the security will be flexible.

## **4. Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**
[Deep packet inspection](https://www.google.com/search?q=Deep+packet+inspection+Firewall&oq=Deep+packet+inspection+Firewall&aqs=chrome..69i57.1012j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) Firewall with the application-level inspection. The downside is that unwanted applications or malware can pass over allowed ports, e.g. outbound Internet traffic over web protocols HTTP and HTTPS, port 80 and 443 respectively.


## Why Do We Need Firewalls?
**Firewalls**, especially Next-Generation Firewalls, focus on blocking malware and application-layer attacks. Firewalls, especially [Next-Generation Firewalls](https://www.google.com/search?q=Next+Generation+Firewall&oq=Next+Generation+Firewall&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59.369j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), focus on blocking malware and application-layer attacks. Task regulate the flow of traffic bypassing the secure data. Without a firewall, hackers can hack that is why you should never shut your firewall. Also, we need to maintain the malware for better performance.
## Conclusion
As the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve and attacks become more sophisticated, Next-Generation Firewalls will continue to be an essential component of any organization’s security solution. Today you might be a billionaire but without a firewall, will lead you to zero. Maintaining proper security that can be done by the firewall is mandatory.
